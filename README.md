# Udemy--Python-Mega-Course-English-Thesaurus
This is my solution to English Thesaurus app exercise from Python Mega Course on Udemy

The goal of this app is to find the meaning for Eglish Words. You can run it typing pyhton3.7 plus the name of the word you are looking for the meaning.

For example, let's suppose I am looking for the meaning of the word git:

jeferson@jeferson:~/Documents/Udemy/Python_Mega_Course$ python3.7 Thesaurus.py
Which word do you want to know? git
A distributed revision control and source code management system with an emphasis on speed.

The app is not case-sensitive so that you can type the way you want:

jeferson@jeferson:~/Documents/Udemy/Python_Mega_Course$ python3.7 Thesaurus.py
Which word do you want to know? Python
(Pythonidae) The common name for a group of non-venomous constricting snakes.

If you make a typo it will try to correct it:

jeferson@jeferson:~/Documents/Udemy/Python_Mega_Course$ python3.7 Thesaurus.py
Which word do you want to know? rainn
Did you mean rain? [Yes/No]y
Precipitation in the form of liquid water drops with diameters greater than 0.5 millimetres.
To fall from the clouds in drops of water.
